The symbol table is represented by a hash table and is unique for identifiers and constants.
The hash table is organized in a dictionary of deques, where a dictionary has a O(1) time
complexity for the search operation and the deque collection provides an O(1) time complexity
for append and pop operations.

These are the functions used in the HashTable class, respectively in SymbolTable class:

    hash_function(value)
        (-only used in HashTable class)
        -time complexity of O(1)
        -computes the hash code using the division method for the given value
        -param value: is of type string
        -return: the hash code for the given value

    insert(value)
        -time complexity of O(1)
        -inserts the given value in the hash table on their corresponding position depending on their computed hash code
        -param value: is of type string

    delete(value)
        -time complexity of O(n)
        -removes the given value in the hash table from their corresponding position depending on their computed hash code
        -param value: is of type string

    search(value):
        -time complexity of O(n)
        -checks if the given value is found in the hash table using their computed hash code
        -param value: is of type string
        -return: True if the value is in the hash table, False otherwise

    get_value_on_position(key,position):
        -time complexity of O(1)
        -gets the value on the given position from the deque with its hash code equal to the given key
        -param key: is of type int, greater or equal than 0, lower than the size of the hash table
        -param position: is of type int, greater or equal than 0, lower than the length deque with its hash code equal to the given key
        -return: the value on the given position with the hash code the same as the given key

    get_index(value):
        -time complexity of O(n)
        -returns the position of the given value in the corresponding deque from the hash table
        -param value: is of type string, value must exist in the hash table
        -return: the position of the value in the deque associated with its hash code
